            Aralects began with a simple frustration shared by countless learners: after years of study, textbook Arabic still sounds stiff and scripted in real-life conversations. The Arabic you see in class isn’t the Arabic you hear on the street, so we set out to bridge that gap with an app purpose‑built for authentic dialogue.

          <p class="text-[#EADFFF] font-medium">
            Today, Aralects is a UAE‑based startup that hopes to turn cutting‑edge AI into bite‑sized, gamified Arabic lessons, with a coverage of spoken dialectal Arabic variants such as Levantine, Maghrebi, Gulf, and Egyptian dialects.

            Our personalization engine learns how you learn—adapting pace, topic, and speech feedback so you're talking like a local from day one. Shared vocabulary across dialects lets you pivot accents without starting over, while native creators keep every dialogue authentic and fun.
