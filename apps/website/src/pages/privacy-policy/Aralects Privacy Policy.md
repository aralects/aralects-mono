# Aralects Privacy Policy

Effective Date: July 17, 2025

Thank you for choosing Aralects for your Arabic learning journey. This Privacy Policy describes what information Aralects collects from you, why we collect it, how we use and share it, and the choices you have regarding your data. We are committed to protecting your privacy and complying with all applicable laws and app store policies (Apple App Store and Google Play Store) for user data protection. By using the Aralects app, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with these practices, please do not use the app.

**Note:** Aralects is not directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from anyone under 13 years of age. If you are under 13, please do not use Aralects or submit any personal data. If we learn that we have collected data from a child under 13, we will delete it promptly in compliance with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and other applicable laws.

## Information We Collect

We collect both information you provide to us and information collected automatically as you use Aralects. This includes:

- **Name and Email**: If you choose to create a profile or join our waiting list, we may collect your name (or a chosen username/nickname) and email address. This allows us to personalize your experience (e.g. display your name on leaderboards or profile) and communicate with you (for example, to send app updates or respond to your inquiries). Providing this information is optional – Aralects does not require creating a traditional user account to use the core features, but a basic profile may be created for your device as described below.
- **Device Profile and Identifier**: When you use Aralects without an account, we generate a unique profile identifier for your device. This device profile stores your progress, preferences, and usage history so that you can seamlessly continue your learning on that device. It functions like a local account tied to the device, allowing us to maintain your streaks, achievements, or leaderboard status even without an email login. This identifier is a random ID (not your phone number or hardware ID) used internally to associate your data with your device.
- **Voice Recordings**: Aralects offers a recording functionality for speaking practice and pronunciation feedback. When you use the speech features (for example, recording your voice to practice a dialogue or test your pronunciation), the app will capture your voice audio. These voice recordings may be processed to assess your pronunciation and provide feedback or corrections. We may store voice recordings and their transcriptions on our secure servers in order to analyze them and improve our language learning services. Voice recordings are treated as personal data since they could potentially identify you; we protect and handle them with a high level of security and confidentiality.
- **Usage Data**: We automatically collect data about how you interact with the app. This includes information such as the lessons or exercises you complete, your scores or progress, features you use, content you click on, and the time and duration of your sessions. It may also include interaction logs like chat conversations or transcripts of your practice sessions (for example, if you engage in a dialogue with our AI tutor, we may save the text of that exchange). This usage data helps us understand learning patterns and user engagement. We anonymize or aggregate usage data for analytics so we can improve Aralects’ content and features without directly identifying individuals.
- **Device and Technical Information**: When you use Aralects, we collect technical information about your device and app to ensure the service works correctly. This may include your device model, operating system version, app version, device language, and unique device identifiers (such as a randomly generated installation ID as noted above, or an advertising ID if used). We also collect network information like your IP address and general location (country or region, not precise GPS) which is usually communicated automatically when you connect to our servers. Additionally, if an error or crash occurs, we might collect technical diagnostic data (for example, crash logs, error messages, and the state of the app when the crash happened). This device and technical information is used to troubleshoot issues, provide compatibility, and protect the service from fraud or misuse.

**Permissions:** For certain features, Aralects may request permissions from your device, such as microphone access (for recording your voice) or storage access (to save downloads or cache data). You have the choice to grant or deny these permissions. If you grant permission, the app will use it solely to provide the related feature (for instance, using the microphone only when you tap the record button for speaking practice). You can revoke permissions at any time in your device settings, which will disable the related features.

## How We Use Your Information

We use the collected information for various purposes in order to provide, maintain, and improve the Aralects experience. Specifically, your data is used in the following ways:

- **To Provide and Personalize the Service**: We use your information to deliver Aralects’s core functionality and content. For example, your voice recordings are used to provide immediate feedback on your pronunciation or speaking exercises. Your name or nickname may be used to personalize in-app content (such as greeting you or displaying on a leaderboard). Usage data (like your progress and performance) is used to personalize your learning experience – for instance, adapting the difficulty of exercises, recommending what to learn next, or creating customized flashcard decks based on what you’ve learned.
- **To Improve Our App and Services**: The data we collect helps us understand what is working well and what can be improved. We analyze usage patterns and learning behavior (in an aggregated, anonymized form) to make informed decisions on improving content, user interface, and features. For example, if many users struggle with a particular lesson, we might refine it. We also may use voice recordings and user interactions to improve our AI capabilities – for instance, to fine-tune our language models or algorithms that evaluate pronunciation and grammar. Any data used for development or research is anonymized or de-identified where possible. This means we look at trends and patterns across many users, not at your individual learning data in isolation, except as needed to debug or enhance your personal experience.
- **Analytics and Learning Research**: Aralects is committed to advancing Arabic learning, so we may aggregate and analyze data about how users learn Arabic. This helps us generate insights into effective learning strategies and common challenges (for example, frequently mispronounced words or common grammar mistakes among learners). These analytics are used internally to improve the app and may be shared in an anonymized, statistical form with educators or in our marketing (e.g., “X% of learners improved their vocabulary recall after 1 month”). No personally identifiable information is included in any published research or external insights – we only use aggregated data for these purposes.
- **Communication**: If you provide an email address, we may use it to send you service-related communications. These include onboarding information, replies to your questions or support requests, and important announcements about the app (for example, changes to this Privacy Policy or security notices). We may also send optional updates such as newsletters, new feature announcements, or language tips, but only if you have agreed to receive such marketing communications. You can opt out of marketing emails at any time by clicking the “unsubscribe” link in the email or contacting us. (Note: We will not spam your inbox – communications will be infrequent and relevant to your Arabic learning journey.)
- **Customer Support**: When you reach out to us (via email or in-app support), we will use any information you provide (which may include your email and details about your issue) to assist you. We may access your profile and usage data to troubleshoot problems or answer questions about your progress. Any additional information you give to our support team will be used only to resolve your request and improve the support experience.
- **Ensure App Functionality and Security**: We use information like device data, logs, and usage patterns to maintain Aralects’ functionality, integrity, and security. This includes monitoring for fraudulent or abusive behavior, debugging crashes or errors, and protecting against unauthorized access. For example, crash reports (via our error monitoring service) help us fix bugs quickly to ensure the app runs smoothly on your device. We may also use certain data to enforce our Terms of Service (for instance, investigating misuse of the app or violations of community guidelines).
- **Legal Compliance**: In the event we need to use or disclose your information to comply with a legal obligation or government request, we will do so only to the extent required by law. (This is described more in “Data Sharing and Disclosure” below.)

We will not use your personal data for purposes that are not compatible with those described above without asking for your consent first. If we plan to use your data for a new purpose (for example, if in the future we introduce a new feature that requires using your information in a different way), we will update this Privacy Policy and notify you as needed to obtain your consent.

## Third-Party Services and Data Processing

Aralects relies on a number of trusted third-party services to operate effectively. We only share your data with these service providers to the extent necessary for them to perform tasks on our behalf, and only for the purposes outlined in this policy. We ensure that any third party with whom we share user data has strong privacy and security practices that meet our standards. The key third-party providers we use (and what we use them for) are:

- **Large Language Model (LLM) Providers (AI Services)**: Aralects uses advanced AI engines to power some of its language learning features. In particular, we integrate services like OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Google’s Gemini, and potentially other AI language models. When you engage in an AI-powered feature (for example, having a practice conversation in Arabic with our chatbot tutor, or asking for an explanation of a phrase), the text of your input and necessary context will be sent to these LLM providers to generate a response. This may include the content of your voice recording (after being transcribed to text) or any messages you type to the AI. We do not share your personal identifiers (like your name or email) with these AI providers – only the content necessary for the AI to respond (e.g. the sentence you spoke or wrote in Arabic). The LLM providers will process the data to return a helpful result. These providers are bound by their own privacy commitments not to use your data for any purpose other than to provide the service to us. For example, OpenAI’s and Google’s APIs have policies in place to protect user privacy (OpenAI, for instance, does not use API data to train their models by default). However, any time data is sent to an external AI service, there is a risk that it may be stored on their servers. We carefully vet these providers and only work with reputable companies. Using the AI features in Aralects signifies your understanding that your relevant input data will be processed by third-party AI services to give you responses.
- **Analytics (PostHog)**: We use PostHog as our analytics platform to collect and analyze usage data about Aralects. PostHog helps us understand how users interact with the app, which features are popular, and where users might be encountering difficulties. Information like your device identifier, actions you take in the app (for example, starting a lesson, completing an exercise, clicking a button), and general device info (as described above) may be sent to PostHog’s analytics servers. We have configured our analytics to avoid collecting sensitive personal information whenever possible. For instance, we do not record any actual lesson content or your voice in analytics events – only metadata such as the ID of the lesson or the fact that you used the voice feature, along with timestamps and performance metrics. IP addresses may be collected by PostHog, but we have the option to anonymize IP (when applicable) to respect privacy. The analytics data helps us improve the app’s design and functionality over time. PostHog is a privacy-focused analytics solution, and we have chosen it in part because it allows self-hosting and compliance with regulations. We either self-host our PostHog analytics or use PostHog Cloud under agreements that ensure data is stored securely and not shared with other parties.
- **Error Monitoring (Sentry)**: Aralects uses Sentry to monitor app crashes and errors. Sentry automatically captures error logs and diagnostic data when the app experiences a crash or a significant error. This data can include device information (such as device model, OS version), the state of the app when the error occurred (which screens were open, which function failed), and limited usage information leading up to the crash. It might also include a user identifier (like the device profile ID or a session ID) to help us pinpoint the issue, but it does not deliberately collect personal content like your name or lesson answers. However, there is a small chance that an error in the app could inadvertently include a snippet of user data in the diagnostic report (for example, the last network request or action that triggered a crash might contain an ID or content piece). We configure Sentry to scrub or mask any known personal data fields, and all data sent to Sentry is transmitted securely. We use the information from Sentry’s reports only to debug and fix issues, improving the app’s stability. Sentry, as a service provider, is contractually obligated to keep our data secure and confidential.
- **Text-to-Speech (TTS) Services**: To provide the spoken audio content in Aralects (like pronunciations, spoken examples, or read-aloud phrases), we utilize external text-to-speech APIs. These may include services from providers such as Google Cloud Text-to-Speech, Amazon Polly, or other similar TTS providers. When the app needs to play audio for a given text (for example, pronouncing an Arabic word or a sentence for you), the text is sent to the external TTS service which generates an audio file and returns it to the app. This means that text from the app (which could be a word you requested to hear, or a sentence in a lesson) is processed by a third-party to synthesize the speech. Typically, this text is from our lesson content or dictionaries. If the text includes any personal data (which is rare, since it’s usually predefined learning content), it is still being transmitted to the TTS provider. We do not send any information like your identity or device info along with the text beyond what the TTS API requires. The audio returned is then played for you and may be cached on your device for performance. The TTS providers we use are reputable and we monitor their privacy terms to ensure they do not store or misuse the provided text beyond generating audio.
- **Cloud Storage and Databases**: Aralects stores user data on secure external servers (cloud infrastructure). This includes databases and storage services provided by third-party hosting providers (for example, cloud service companies such as Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform, or others — whichever our app infrastructure is built on). All your data – including profile information, progress, voice recording files, and usage logs – resides in these databases. We implement measures like encryption at rest and in transit for data in our databases. The providers hosting our data are under strict obligations to safeguard it. We do not publicly expose your information; access to these databases is limited to authorized Aralects team members and the app itself (via authenticated requests). Our cloud providers may technically have access to stored data as part of maintaining the service, but they are not allowed to use or view it except for legitimate maintenance or legal compliance reasons. We have data processing agreements in place with such providers to ensure your data receives the same level of protection as if it were stored by us directly.

We want to reassure you that we do not sell your personal data to any third parties. The third-party integrations listed above are used solely to enhance the Aralects service (for analytics, AI functionality, etc.), and each provider is restricted in how they can process your data. We carefully select partners who are compliant with privacy laws and we share only the minimum information necessary with them. Aside from the service providers listed, Aralects will not share your personal information with other parties unless one of the following circumstances applies (as described in the next section).

## Data Sharing and Disclosure

We treat your personal information with care and do not disclose it to outside parties except in certain situations described here:

- **Service Providers**: As detailed above, we share data with third-party service providers who need the information to perform tasks on our behalf (such as AI processing, analytics, etc.). They are contractually obligated to keep your data confidential and use it only for the specified purposes. We ensure that any company we partner with respects strict data privacy standards similar to our own.
- **Legal Requirements**: We may disclose your information if required to do so by law or in response to a valid legal request (e.g., a subpoena, court order, or government demand). We will only provide the data specifically demanded by such legal process and only when we believe in good faith that disclosure is legally necessary. Additionally, if we believe it is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, or to protect the rights, property, or safety of Aralects, our users, or others, we may do so as permitted by law. This includes exchanging information with law enforcement or other agencies for fraud protection or security matters.
- **Business Transfers**: If Aralects is involved in a merger, acquisition, investment, reorganization, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your information may be transferred as part of that transaction. We would ensure that the acquiring organization continues to be bound by confidentiality obligations in respect to your personal data and that they honor this Privacy Policy (unless you are notified of changes and given a chance to opt-out). We will notify you (for example, via email or a prominent notice in the app) of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information as a result of a business transaction, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information in that event.
- **With Your Consent**: In all other cases not covered above, if there is ever a need to share your information with any third party, we will notify you and obtain your explicit consent. For instance, if in the future Aralects wanted to partner with a research institution to study language learning and needed to share a certain data set, we would only do so with data that is anonymized or with your consent if it were identifiable.

Importantly, we do NOT sell, rent, or trade your personal information to advertisers or other external companies for their independent use. We also do not share personal data for marketing by third parties. Any data sharing that occurs is solely for the purposes of running and improving our own service as outlined in this policy.

## Data Retention

We will retain your personal data for as long as it is needed to fulfill the purposes described in this policy, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law. In general:

- **Profile Information (Name, Email)**: If you have provided a name or email, we keep this information as long as you continue to use Aralects. If you are on our waiting list or have subscribed to updates, we retain your contact info until you opt-out or ask us to delete it. If you withdraw your consent or request deletion, we will remove your name/email from our active databases (except as needed to comply with legal obligations or resolve disputes).
- **Device Profile and Usage Data**: Data associated with your device’s profile (like your progress, settings, and usage history) is stored for as long as you use the app on that device and for a reasonable period thereafter. Even if you stop actively using Aralects, we may retain your usage data and profile for some time in case you return, to improve our services, or to compile aggregate analytics. In practice, if your app has been inactive for an extended period (for example, 1–2 years), we may remove or anonymize the data associated with that inactive profile during periodic clean-ups. We will also do so sooner upon your request (see Your Rights below).
- **Voice Recordings**: We store voice recordings and their transcripts on our servers to enable the speaking exercises and to improve our speech recognition and feedback algorithms. We retain these recordings as long as needed to provide the feature and to conduct analysis for improvement. If you delete the app or request deletion of your data, voice recordings associated with your profile will be deleted from our systems (unless we are required to retain them for legal reasons). We may retain anonymized features extracted from voice data (for example, aggregated pronunciation error rates or acoustic model parameters) which are no longer tied to any identifiable user, purely for improving our services.
- **Analytics and Logs**: Analytics data (through PostHog) and error logs (through Sentry) are generally kept for an intermediate amount of time to allow us to analyze trends and troubleshoot. This might range from a few months to a couple of years of history. We periodically review and purge old analytics records that are no longer needed. Aggregated data (which has no personal identifiers) may be kept longer for historical analysis.
- **Backups**: Like many services, our databases are routinely backed up to prevent data loss. Even after data is deleted from our active systems, it may remain in encrypted backups for a short period until those backups expire and are overwritten. We have retention schedules for backups and do not use backup data except for restoration purposes in disaster recovery scenarios.

When we no longer have a legitimate need to retain your personal information, we will securely delete or anonymize it. If deletion (or anonymization) is not immediately possible (for example, because the data is stored in archived backups), then we will securely store and isolate the data from any further use until deletion is feasible.

## Data Security

We take the security of your personal information seriously. Aralects implements a variety of technical and organizational measures to protect your data from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. These measures include:

- **Encryption**: All communication between the Aralects app and our servers is encrypted using HTTPS (TLS) to prevent eavesdropping. Sensitive data (such as passwords if any, although currently Aralects may not require a password due to no mandatory accounts) is encrypted in transit and, where applicable, encrypted at rest in our databases or storage. For example, voice recordings and personal details are stored in secure cloud storage with encryption at rest.
- **Access Controls**: Access to personal data within our organization is restricted on a need-to-know basis. Only authorized team members (for example, a support engineer or developer troubleshooting an issue) will access user data, and even then, only the minimum necessary data is accessed. All staff are trained on the importance of user privacy and security. We also use authentication, keys, and other safeguards to ensure that our internal access to systems is secure.
- **Security Testing and Best Practices**: We keep our software and frameworks up to date to protect against security vulnerabilities. We employ best practices in development to guard against common security issues (such as SQL injection, XSS, etc.). The third-party services we use (PostHog, Sentry, OpenAI, etc.) are all reputable companies that also maintain high security standards. We monitor our systems for any signs of unauthorized access or anomalies.
- **Anonymization and Minimization**: Where possible, we reduce the privacy risk by anonymizing data (removing or hashing personal identifiers) and by collecting only the data that we truly need (data minimization principle). For instance, if we just need aggregate usage counts, we may not store detailed logs tied to user identities beyond the duration needed.

While we strive to protect your data, it’s important to note that no method of transmission over the internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee absolute security. However, we continuously review and enhance our security practices to mitigate risks. In the unlikely event of a data breach that affects your personal information, we will notify you and the appropriate authorities as required by law.

## Your Rights and Choices

We believe you should have control over your personal data. In accordance with privacy regulations and app store requirements, we provide you with the following rights and choices regarding your information:

- **Access and Correction**: You have the right to access the personal information we hold about you. If you would like to know what data we have collected from you, you can contact us (see Contact Us below) and we will provide you with a copy of your data. If any of your information is inaccurate or has changed (for example, you want to update your email or correct your name spelling), you can request that we correct or update it. Because Aralects profiles are device-based, most personal data is limited, but we will assist you in accessing or updating it as needed.
- **Deletion of Data**: You have the right to request deletion of your personal data. Yes, you will be able to have your data deleted – if you no longer wish to use Aralects or you want us to remove specific information (such as voice recordings or your email address), you can ask us to delete it. We will erase the requested personal data from our active systems, except for information we are required to keep by law. Keep in mind that deleting your data may erase your learning progress and any saved preferences, so you will not be able to recover that data later. We will inform you of the consequences if you choose to delete your data. To request deletion, contact us via the email provided in the Contact section. We will verify your identity (to protect against fraudulent requests) and then proceed with deletion in a reasonable timeframe, notifying you when completed.
- **Withdraw Consent / Object to Processing**: In cases where we rely on your consent to process data (for example, for optional features or marketing emails), you have the right to withdraw that consent at any time. For instance, you can turn off the microphone permission if you no longer want us to collect your voice, or you can unsubscribe from our newsletter if you no longer wish to receive it. If you feel that any aspect of our data processing is not necessary for the service, you can object to it by contacting us. We will review such requests and stop or limit processing where required by applicable law. For example, if you don’t want your usage data to be used in our analytics, we will provide an opt-out method or exclude your data upon request.
- **Portability**: If you request it, and if it’s technically feasible, we can provide you with a copy of certain information in a common format. For example, we could export your learning progress data or any personal information we have into a JSON or CSV file for you. This is in line with data portability rights under laws like GDPR, allowing you to reuse your data elsewhere.
- **Opt-Out of Analytics/Tracking**: As noted, you can contact us to opt out of non-essential data collection such as analytics. While Aralects does not use third-party advertising trackers, we do use analytics and crash reporting. If you prefer not to be included even in anonymized analytics, let us know and we can exclude your device from our analytics tools (for example, by filtering out your device profile or providing a setting to disable analytics). Do note that crash reporting is important for app stability; however, you can also opt out of Sentry crash reporting by contacting us, and we will respect that choice by not associating crash data with your profile.
- **Do Not Track Signals**: Some jurisdictions allow for “Do Not Track” signals or similar mechanisms. While there is no standardized way for mobile apps to receive a Do Not Track signal like a web browser does, we want to reiterate that we do not track your activity across third-party apps or websites for advertising purposes. We limit data collection to within the Aralects app for the purposes described. If in the future we integrate something that could be seen as cross-app tracking, we will provide a clear opt-in for that.
- **California Privacy Rights**: (If you are a California resident) California law (CCPA/CPRA) may provide you with additional rights such as the right to know categories of personal information collected, disclosed, or sold (we do not sell data), and the right to not be discriminated against for exercising privacy rights. Aralects provides the same core rights to all users, but California residents can reach out with any specific concerns under those laws and we will accommodate as required.
- **European Union (GDPR) Rights**: If you are in the EU or UK, you have certain rights under GDPR/data protection laws, including many of the rights listed above (access, rectification, erasure, restriction of processing, objection, and portability). You also have the right to lodge a complaint with a Data Protection Authority if you believe we have violated your privacy rights. We address all users’ requests with a high standard, but EU users can specifically invoke GDPR rights and we will comply accordingly.

To exercise any of your rights or choices, or if you have any privacy-related questions, you can contact us at the email provided below. We will respond to your request as soon as possible and at most within any timeframes required by law. Please note that for certain requests (like deleting data or accessing data), we may need to verify your identity to ensure the security of your account/profile.

## Children’s Privacy

Aralects is intended for use by teens and adults interested in learning Arabic, and is not directed to children under 13 years of age. We do not knowingly solicit or collect personal information from children under 13. If you are under 13, please do not use the app or provide any information about yourself (such as your name, email, voice recordings, etc.). If we become aware that we have inadvertently collected personal data from a child under 13, we will take steps to delete that information promptly from our servers.

**Parents or guardians:** If you discover that your child under 13 has been using Aralects and may have provided personal information to us, please contact us immediately. We will work with you to remove any such data and, if needed, disable the child’s access to the app. While users under 13 are not permitted, for older minors (e.g., 13-15) we also recommend parental supervision and awareness. Aralects’ content is generally educational, but it’s important that any minors use the app in accordance with our terms and under supervision if necessary.

By using Aralects, you affirm that you are at least 13 years old. We reserve the right to ask for age verification if we suspect a user is underage, and to refuse service if adequate confirmation of age is not provided when requested.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update or modify this Privacy Policy from time to time as our practices or relevant laws change. If we make changes, we will notify you by updating the “Effective Date” at the top of this policy. In the case of significant changes that materially affect how your personal data is processed, we will provide a more prominent notice as well – for example, by sending an email to the address we have on file (if you provided one) or by displaying an in-app notification. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any updates. Your continued use of Aralects after any changes to this Privacy Policy constitutes your acceptance of the updated terms.

If you do not agree with any changes to the Privacy Policy, you should stop using the app and you may request that we delete your data as described above. Any changes will not retroactively apply to personal data collected in the past without your consent.
